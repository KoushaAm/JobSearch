Homepage: The homepage should have a simple and user-friendly interface. It should include a search bar for users to enter keywords related to their job search. The homepage should also display popular job categories, recent job postings, and a call to action for users to create an account or sign in.

Job Listings: The website should have a comprehensive database of job listings that users can search through. Each job listing should include a job title, description, location, and application instructions. Users should be able to filter job listings by location, industry, job type, and salary range.

Job Alerts: Users should be able to set up job alerts based on their search criteria. This will allow them to receive email notifications when new job listings matching their criteria are added to the website.
